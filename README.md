## 🏗️ Data Infrastructure & Modeling (Engineering Layer)

### Key Components

- **Source Files**: Simulated ERP and CRM systems, each provided in CSV format.
- **Data Cleansing**: Cleaning and validation routines are implemented to resolve quality issues before loading.
- **Modeling**: The two source systems are combined into a single, analysis-friendly schema optimized for BI tools and SQL queries.
- **Scope**: Work is focused solely on the current dataset; historical tracking is out of scope.
- **Documentation**: The final data model is clearly documented to support both technical users and non-technical stakeholders.
